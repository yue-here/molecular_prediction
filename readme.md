This is a project on predicting the enzyme inhibition ability of molecules using deep learning, starting from SMILES representations of the molecules.

Three model types are implemented for comparison: a traditional machine learning  using gradient boosting as baseline model, a transformer operating on SMILES strings, and a graph neural network operating on molecular graphs.

See [`project_report.ipynb`](project_report.ipynb) for full details.
